Description
This project focuses on exploring SQL fundamentals and working with employee data. The primary goal is to perform various analyses and calculations related to employee start dates, end dates, and active status on specific dates.
Data Sources
The project utilizes two main data sources:
employees table: Contains employee information, including their start date (startdate) and end date (enddate). If an employee is currently active, the enddate field will be NULL.
dates table: Contains a list of dates (datekey) represented in a specific format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
